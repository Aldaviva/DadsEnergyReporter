Send monthly electricity usage reports from SolarCity, aligned to Orange & Rockland billing cycles.

## Problem

My parents' house gets its electricity from both [Orange & Rockland](https://www.oru.com), a public utility company, and two arrays of roof-mounted solar panels leased from [SolarCity](http://www.solarcity.com/).

My dad wants to know how many kilowatt-hours of electricity were generated by the solar panels compared to how many were bought from the utility each month, so that he can tell how much of an impact the solar panels are making on his electricity cost.

### Challenges

- SolarCity provides a web application, [MySolarCity](https://mysolarcity.com/), that shows how much electricity was generated using a reporting tool called [PowerGuide](https://mysolarcity.com/#/monitoring). You can view graphs for a given day, month, or year. Unfortunately, PowerGuide reports are always aligned to the start of the report period, for example, month reports always start on the 1st of the month.
- Orange & Rockland billing cycles never begin on the 1st of the month. In fact, the billing date is completely unpredictable. The most common billing date is the 17th, but only 42% of the past two years of bills actually ended on the 17th, and they have varied between the 15th and 21st with no discernible pattern.

## Solution

I wrote a program that can be run periodically to send an email report of electricity statistics for both Orange & Rockland and SolarCity.

### Algorithm

1. Log in to Orange & Rockland
1. Log in to MySolarCity
1. Download [ESPI Green Button Data](https://naesb.org/espi_standards.asp) from Orange & Rockland
1. Extract the start and end date, kWh consumed, and billing amount from the Green Button data for the most recent billing interval
1. Download PowerGuide measurements from MySolarCity
1. Extract the kWh generated from the PowerGuide data for the most recent billing interval 
1. Send an email report containing this information
1. Log out of Orange & Rockland and MySolarCity
1. Persist the billing date to avoid resending the report for the same billing interval the next time this program runs
1. Exit

## Usage
1. Make sure you have [.NET Framework 4.7](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=55170) or later installed
1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Aldaviva/DadsEnergyReporter/releases) (the ZIP file, but not the source code one)
1. Extract the ZIP file
1. Edit `DadsEnergyReporter.exe.config` and set the `<value></value>` of each Setting
    - `solarCityUsername` is the email address you use to log in to [MySolarCity](https://mysolarcity.com/)
    - `solarCityPassword` is the password you use to log in to MySolarCity
    - `orangeRocklandUsername` is the username you use to log in to [Orange & Rockland My Account](https://apps.coned.com/ORMyAccount/Forms/login.aspx)
    - `orangeRocklandPassword` is the password you use to log in to Orange & Rockland My Account
    - `reportSenderEmail` is the email address that will appear in the From field of report emails that are sent to you
    - `reportRecipientEmails` are the email addresses to which report emails will be sent. To send reports to more than one email address, add additional `<string>your@email.com</string>` elements.
    - `smtpHost` is the hostname or IP address of the server that you use to send outgoing email. The server must support STARTTLS authentication.
    - `smtpPort` is the TCP port number of the server that you use to send outgoing email
    - `smtpUsername` is the username that you use to log in to the server that sends your outgoing email. Required, no anonymous SMTP allowed.
    - `smtpPassword` is the password that you use to log in to the server that sends your outgoing email. Required, no anonymous SMTP allowed.
1. Run `DadsEnergyReporter.exe`. Logs appear in the command prompt output.
1. Check your email for the usage report
